# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-in-Tableau
Title: Leveraging Tableau for Comprehensive COVID-19 Data Analysis

üåü Introduction:
The project encompasses two primary datasets:

1. COVID-19 Daily Report Data:
   - Detailed collection of COVID-19 attributes.
   - Includes date of reporting, country-specific information, and World Health Organization (WHO) regions.
   - Key statistics provided: new cases, cumulative cases, new deaths, and cumulative deaths.
   - Enables granular tracking of the daily progress of the pandemic.

2. COVID-19 WHO Region Data:
   - Focuses on WHO regions.
   - Provides information on cumulative cases, cases per 100,000 population, cases reported in the last 7 days, cases per 100,000 population in the last 7 days, cases reported in the last 24 hours, cumulative deaths, deaths per 100,000 population, deaths reported in the last 7 days, and deaths per 100,000 population in the last 7 days.
   - Allows assessment of regional disparities and patterns within the pandemic.

üìà Objective:
The primary objective of this Tableau analysis project is to transform these raw datasets into meaningful visualizations and insights. By leveraging the power of Tableau, we will create dynamic dashboards and reports that offer a clear, concise, and interactive view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

üîç Project Details:

1. Data Preparation:
   - Importing and cleaning the raw datasets to ensure data integrity.
   - Addressing missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.

2. Visualization Creation:
   - Utilizing Tableau's features to create a variety of visualizations, including but not limited to:
     - Line charts to track daily trends in cases and deaths.
     - Bar charts to compare statistics across different countries and regions.
     - Geospatial maps to visualize the spread of COVID-19 globally and regionally.
     - Heatmaps to highlight areas with high concentration of cases.
     - Treemaps to represent proportional distribution of cases by country or region.

3. Dashboard Development:
   - Designing interactive dashboards that allow users to explore data dynamically.
   - Incorporating filters, parameters, and tooltips for enhanced user experience.
   - Ensuring the dashboards are intuitive and easy to navigate.

4. Insights Generation:
   - Analyzing the visualizations to identify trends, patterns, and correlations.
   - Extracting actionable insights to aid decision-making processes for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the general public.
   - Providing context and commentary to accompany the visualizations.

5. Iterative Refinement:
   - Soliciting feedback from stakeholders to improve the clarity and effectiveness of the visualizations.
   - Iteratively refining the dashboards based on user input and changing data dynamics.

6. Documentation and Presentation:
   - Documenting the data sources, methodologies, and assumptions used in the analysis.
   - Creating a presentation to communicate the findings and implications of the analysis to stakeholders.

By undertaking this Tableau analysis project, we aim to contribute to the collective understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and empower decision-makers with actionable insights to mitigate its impact.
